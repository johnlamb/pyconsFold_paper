	abstract = {Protein structure prediction is a longstanding challenge in computational biology. Through extension of deep learning-based prediction to interresidue orientations in addition to distances, and the development of a constrained optimization by Rosetta, we show that more accurate models can be generated. Results on a set of 18 de novo-designed proteins suggests the proposed method should be directly applicable to current challenges in de novo protein design.The prediction of interresidue contacts and distances from coevolutionary data using deep learning has considerably advanced protein structure prediction. Here, we build on these advances by developing a deep residual network for predicting interresidue orientations, in addition to distances, and a Rosetta-constrained energy-minimization protocol for rapidly and accurately generating structure models guided by these restraints. In benchmark tests on 13th Community-Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP13)- and Continuous Automated Model Evaluation (CAMEO)-derived sets, the method outperforms all previously described structure-prediction methods. Although trained entirely on native proteins, the network consistently assigns higher probability to de novo-designed proteins, identifying the key fold-determining residues and providing an independent quantitative measure of the {\textquotedblleft}ideality{\textquotedblright} of a protein structure. The method promises to be useful for a broad range of protein structure prediction and design problems.},
